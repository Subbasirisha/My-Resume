            <li><h3>Group picture lens - Machine Learning with Python</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project is aimed to retrieve the data of a particular person from a group image which is the growing 
                        interest in the current digital world. Face detection and recognition has transcended from an esoteric 
                        to a popular area of research in computer vision and has become the most successful applications. This program is being developed using OpenCV, Python and CNN for image analysis and algorithm-based 
                        understanding</li>

            <li><h3>Self driving surveillance - Machine Learning with Python </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project is aimed to identify and analyzes the conditions in which the vehicle is placed, and 
                        determines the driving plans appropriate to the driving environment and the objectives. The control 
                        step determines the speed, direction, etc. about the driving and the vehicle starts driving on its own. 
                        An autonomous driving vehicle performs various actions to arrive at its destination, repeating the 
                        steps of recognition, judgment and control on its own. This is developed by the help of MLP 
                        Algorithm, Random Forest Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm</li>
